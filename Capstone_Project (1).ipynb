    "   Houston Texas is the largest city in the state comprising of 88 super neighborhoods with an estimated population of 2,325,502. Houston is commonly known for its food, job availability, night life, and NASA. With this popularity Houston is classified as one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. With this ever-increasing population comes a growing demand to address the needs of the residents that make Houston home.  One of the largest problems facing the city is that of food deserts. Food deserts according to the CDC are “areas that lack access to affordable fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat milk, and other foods that make up the full range of a healthy diet.” Individuals living in areas classified as food deserts are shown to have an increased risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and being obese. While food deserts can be present in areas typically associated as having low income, they can be present in any area that causes an individual to not have easy access to an available grocery store, and overall, about 23.5 million Americans and a reported 250,000  individuals living in Houston, TX lack easy access to grocery stores according to Rice University.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   While living in food deserts are shown to negatively impact ones health, these areas would present lower competition for new grocery stores and allow for a perfect opportunity for business owners to open new grocery stores that not only help alleviate public health concerns, but to also serve the demand for fresh food for individuals that live in impacted areas leading to a greater possibility for a successful store.  \n",

This project is relevant as food deserts are not just a public health issue, but are an untapped resource for business and developers who are looking at finding an area to create a store with the highest probability of success and in areas with low competition.  \n",
