## The Battle Of The Neighborhoods

The objective of this project is to find what neighborhoods could possibly be labeled as food deserts and to select the best locations to open a new grocery store that not only alleviates the problem of food deserts but also has the best probability of success due to lack of competition in the city of Houston, Tx.
